# Spinatra

Making my first Ruby gem. It will have some functionality of Rails for Sinatra applications. Creating scaffolding for new application, and maybe more in the future.

It is becoming opinionated, I am using slim as a default templating language. And I am including all required files for slim.

## Building Gem
`gem build spinatra.gemspec`

## Installing gem
`gem install spinatra-<version_number>.gem`

## Usage
`spinatra new <project_name> [ -v| --verbose ]`
